Fusee
=====

Fusee aims at becoming a multiplatform 3D realtime engine with 
a strong emphasis on content transformation and manipulation.

Fusee is written mainly in C# and can be programmed in C#. 

Fusee builds bridges to make your code run in environments that
don't support C#, like Content-Creation-Software C++ Plug-In-APIs
and native HTML5/WebGL Javascript code.
